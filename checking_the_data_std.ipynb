    "One of the worst things that can happen in any analysis project is finding that weeks of work are wasted and all the conclusions drawn are false because there was a problem with the data set. For example it was loaded in incorrectly or the client made a mistake when putting the data together. Running through the checks described below can save you a lot of effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you proceed in your analysis it is also very useful to have a set of summary statistics against which to sense check the numbers. For example, if you are analysing customer data, then you should always keep in mind, as a benchmark, the total number of unique customers in the data set.\n",

    "2. Or it could be that some of the fields were given the wrong data type (e.g. a number is loaded as a text string)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Or perhaps the software didnâ€™t understand some of the values and replaced them with NAs\n",

    "1. There might have been data entry or processing errors that resulted in wrong or missing values in some of the fields.\n",
